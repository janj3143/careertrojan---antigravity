Subject: Interview Availability – {{role_title}} – {{candidate_name}}

Dear {{hiring_manager_name}},

Thank you for considering my application for the **{{role_title}}** role at **{{company_name}}** and for the invitation to interview.

I am very interested in the position. I have a prior commitment at the time originally suggested, but I am
available at the following times:

- {{option_1}}  
- {{option_2}}  
- {{option_3}}

If none of these work, I’m happy to adjust where possible.

Thank you again for the opportunity. I look forward to speaking with you.

Kind regards,  
{{candidate_name}}
