Subject: Interest in {{team_or_product_area}} – {{candidate_name}}

Dear {{contact_name}},

Your recent work on **{{exa_product_or_release}}** and the focus on {{exa_theme_from_news}} at **{{company_name}}**
really resonated with me.

I specialise in {{specialism}} and have delivered {{headline_result}} in similar environments. I’m therefore writing
speculatively to ask whether there might be scope to contribute within {{target_team_or_chapter}} – now or in the near future.

In my current role at {{current_company}}, I:

- {{impact_bullet_1}}  
- {{impact_bullet_2}}  
- {{impact_bullet_3}}

I’d welcome the opportunity to learn more about how {{company_name}} is approaching {{topic}}, and to explore whether
my experience might be a useful addition to the team.

I’ve included my CV for reference and would be happy to speak at a time that suits you.

Best regards,  
{{candidate_name}}
