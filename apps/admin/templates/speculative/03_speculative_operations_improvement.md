Subject: Supporting {{company_name}}’s Operational Goals

Dear {{contact_name}},

I’ve been reading about **{{exa_operational_initiative}}** and the steps **{{company_name}}** is taking to improve
{{operational_focus_area}}. This aligns closely with the work I’ve been doing in {{candidate_sector_or_role}} over
the last {{years_experience}} years.

My background includes leading improvements in {{improvement_area}}, resulting in {{quantified_result}}.
I’m reaching out speculatively to ask whether there might be room for someone with my skills in {{target_function}}.

A few relevant highlights:

- {{impact_bullet_1}}  
- {{impact_bullet_2}}  
- {{impact_bullet_3}}

If there is a suitable contact in your team or elsewhere in the organisation whom you feel I should speak with,
I’d be grateful if you might point me in the right direction.

Thank you for considering my note. I’d be delighted to connect.

Kind regards,  
{{candidate_name}}
