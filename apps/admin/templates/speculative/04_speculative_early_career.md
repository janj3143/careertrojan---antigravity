Subject: Speculative Enquiry – Early-Career Opportunities

Dear {{contact_name}},

I am an early-career {{profession_or_student_status}} with a strong interest in **{{company_name}}**.
I’ve particularly enjoyed following **{{exa_recent_article_title}}**, which highlighted your work in {{theme}}.

I’m writing speculatively to ask whether you ever recruit entry-level talent into {{target_area}}.
My recent experience includes {{brief_experience_summary}} and I am especially keen to develop in {{development_focus}}.

I have attached my CV for context. Even if there are no current vacancies, I would be grateful for any guidance
you might be able to offer on future opportunities or key skills you look for.

Many thanks for your time.

Best regards,
