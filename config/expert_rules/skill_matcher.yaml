# Skill matching rules — used by the expert system inference pipeline
# referenced as: expert_system.skill_matcher
#
# Weighted scoring system for matching user skills to role requirements

scoring:
  # How much each factor contributes to the final match score (must sum to 1.0)
  weights:
    exact_skill_match: 0.35        # User has exact skill name
    semantic_similarity: 0.25      # Embedding distance < threshold
    transferable_skills: 0.15      # Related skills that transfer
    certification_bonus: 0.10      # Relevant certs boost score
    experience_depth: 0.15         # Years in skill area

  thresholds:
    strong_match: 0.80             # Above this = "Strong Match"
    moderate_match: 0.55           # Above this = "Good Match"
    weak_match: 0.30               # Above this = "Possible Match"
    # Below weak_match = "Skill Gap"

# Transferable skill mappings: if user has skill A, they get partial credit for B
